"""
The pipelines are a great and easy way to use models for inference. These pipelines are objects that abstract most of the 
complex code from the library, offering a simple API dedicated to several tasks, including Named Entity Recognition, 
Masked Language Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Extraction and Question Answering
